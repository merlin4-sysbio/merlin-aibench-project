/**
 * Tree-specific implementation of RolloverProducer.

 * This implementation assumes a "hit" for rollover if the mouse is anywhere in
 * the total width of the tree. Additionally, a pressed to the right (but
 * outside of the label bounds) is re-dispatched as a pressed just inside the
 * label bounds. This is a first go for #166-swingx.

 * PENDING JW: bidi-compliance of pressed?
